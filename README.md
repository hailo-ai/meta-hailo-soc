## Usage
### Prerequisites
	
- Install [kas](https://pypi.org/project/kas/) python package.
### Development
- kas directory contains the yml configurations used to initiate the [Bitbake](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/) environment 
- To initialize the environment and start image compilation run: 
	- `kas build kas/hailo15-evb.yml`
- To start working with Bitbake CLI, activate the environment by:
	- `source poky/oe-init-build-env`
